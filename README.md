# chatbot
In this Python project with source code, I built a chatbot using deep learning techniques. The chatbot will be trained on the dataset which contains categories (intents), pattern and responses.
I used a special recurrent neural network (LSTM) to classify which category the userâ€™s message belongs to and then I gave a random response from the list of responses.
